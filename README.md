Our project is a 3lb combat robot made to compete at NHRL and other combat robotics events. Our combat robot is a vertical spinner with a wedge and forks.

We made this project as a part of our combat robotics club. We created this as our first 3lb robot with experience we learned on 150g battlebots.
